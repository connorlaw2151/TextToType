# TextToType
This is a really simple program that will type whatever you put in a text file. Supply the text file as an arguments. It types each word at a time and then presses enter. Be careful! This takes over your keyboard. You can still type manually but it will type wherever your cursor is selected.

The example file included here is the bee movie (beemovie.txt).

Requires Python3 to be installed
